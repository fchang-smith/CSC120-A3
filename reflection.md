Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Laura Lyu, Clara Yang
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
The one on Tuesday evening
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It is very different from python and much implicit as a language for human to understand. (like using System.out.print instead of just print)
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Similarity: the basic logic is the same for both language, like how for loop works, if statements, and so on. Differences: basically the syntax thing, and different function/method to use.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I just realized that a lot of the string methods we learned in python do not work in java, because the string in java cannot be changed by index. You cannot simply write str[idx] = blablabla.
